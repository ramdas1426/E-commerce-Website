B00LPDV9T2,Expert Oracle Database Architecture 3rd ed. Edition,"Now in its third edition, this best-selling book continues to bring you some of the best thinking on how to apply Oracle Database to produce scalable applications that perform well and deliver correct results. Tom Kyte and Darl Kuhn share a simple philosophy: ""you can treat Oracle as a black box and just stick data into it, or you can understand how it works and exploit it as a powerful computing environment."" If you choose the latter, then you’ll find that there are few information management problems that you cannot solve quickly and elegantly. This fully revised third edition covers the developments up to Oracle Database 12c. Significant new content is included surrounding Oracle's new cloud feature set, and especially the use of pluggable databases. Each feature is taught in a proof-by-example manner, not only discussing what it is, but also how it works, how to implement software using it, and the common pitfalls associated with it. Don’t treat Oracle Database as a black-box. Get this book. Get under the hood. Turbo-charge your career.    Revised to cover Oracle Database 12c    Proof-by-example approach: Let the evidence be your guide    Dives deeply into Oracle Database’s most powerful features What you’ll learn    Develop an evidence-based approach to problem solving    Manage transactions in highly concurrent environments    Speed access to data through table and index design    Manage files and memory structures for performance and reliability    Scale up through partitioning and parallel processing    Load and unload data to interface with external systems Who this book is for Expert Oracle Database Architecture is aimed at Oracle Database administrators, at PL/SQL and Java developers writing code to be deployed inside the database, and at developers of external applications who use Oracle Database as a data store.

B00OLET4FI,Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed,"Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed provides much-needed information for building scalable, high-concurrency applications and deploy them against the Oracle Database. Read this short, 150-page book that is adapted from Expert Oracle Database Architecture to gain a solid and accurate understanding of how locking and concurrency are dealt with by Oracle Database. Also learn how the Oracle Database architecture accommodates user transactions, and how you can write code to mesh with how Oracle Database is designed to operate. Good transaction design is an important facet of highly-concurrent applications that are run by hundreds, even thousands of users who are all executing transactions at the same time. Transaction design in turn relies upon a good understanding of how the underlying database platform manages of the locking of resources so as to prevent access conflicts and data loss that might otherwise result from concurrent access to data in the database.Oracle Database Transactions and Locking Revealed covers in detail the various lock types, and also different locking schemes such as pessimistic and optimistic locking. Then you’ll learn about transaction isolation and multiversion concurrency, and how the various lock types support Oracle Database’s transactional features. You’ll learn some good tips for transaction design, as well as some bad practices and habits to avoid. Coverage is also given to redo and undo, and their role in concurrency. This is an important book that anyone developing highly-concurrent applications will want to have handy on their shelf.",5.0 out of 5 stars,29.99$,23.42$,Thomas Kyte,188,English,7.5 x 0.4 x 9.2 inches,15 ounces,1310 KB,http://res.cloudinary.com/maravind/image/upload/v1491189802/B00OLET4FI_e3dk98.jpg
